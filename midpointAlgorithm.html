<title>Andrew Beane's Attempt At Canvas Midpoint Algorithms!</title>

<body>
 <h1>Andrew Beane Computer Graphics - Assignment 1 - Midpoint Algorithm</h1>
 <p>Click and hold mouse to draw pixel by pixel free hand!</p>
<p>Features: Each Button draws a token example of each object type. 
  Extra Features:
    For The Rectangle, Circle And Ellipse if you continue to click. A shading effect is implemented
    so for each subsequent click it shades the object inward towards the center.
    If you click on two points within the canvas it will draw a line using the midpoint algorithm. 
    To Note some line appear not to draw successfully - but intermittently the same line in orientation
    would work sometimes and not others.
    Third feature when you are not clicking within the canvas and are simpling scrolling over it, the web app
    (my program) will fill in pixel by pixel. If you scroll too fast it misses any - so the slower you move the more solid
    of a line you get.
    Line - Check, Circle - Check. Ellipse - Check.   Polyline Check.   Polygon - Check. Extra Features - Check. Interactive Feature -Check. To Note Please Scroll Down to see the Rectangle -- May not fit in full window for smaller Monitor. </p>
