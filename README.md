# midpointAlgorithm
Bresenham's Midpoint Algorithm with HTML Canvas and JavaScript.

Simple HTML demonstration using JavaScript to demonstrate Bresnham's midpoint algorithm. 
The HTML page contains 6 buttons, for a line, polyline, circle, ellipse, and polygon. 

The last piece is that when you are over the canvas you, the JavaScript code retrieves the user's mouse coordinates, and does a simple
(pixel by pixel) free hand draw. The behavior of this is not perfect - and the performance seems to cause a loss of pixels if the user
moves the mouse curson too quickly.
